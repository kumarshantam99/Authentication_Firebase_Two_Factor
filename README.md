# Firebase_Auth
A React+ Firebase authentication system for my future productions.

Implementation of Two Factor Authentication using Express, JSONDB, speakeasy and authenticator (google extension) to validate the secret. Next implementation will be to link this backend with a QR code frontend for better User Experience.
